# Smart Energy Meter

## Introduction
The Smart Energy Meter project is designed to monitor electricity consumption in real time using Arduino and sensor modules. The system helps users understand how much energy is being consumed and reduces unnecessary power wastage.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to measure voltage, current, and power consumption and display the readings on an LCD screen. The system can also be connected to an IoT platform for remote monitoring.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Current Sensor
- Voltage Sensor
- LCD Display
- WiFi Module
- Power Supply

## Working Principle
The sensors measure voltage and current from the load. The Arduino processes these signals and calculates the power consumption. The measured values are displayed on the LCD and can also be transmitted to an online server for real-time monitoring.

## Applications
- Household energy monitoring
- Industrial energy tracking
- Smart grid systems

## Conclusion
This project provides an efficient way to monitor energy consumption and helps in reducing electricity wastage by providing real-time usage information.
